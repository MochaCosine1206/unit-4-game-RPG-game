Seinfeld RPG is a simple demonstration of jquery and javascript counters.

In the game, you should be able to:
 - choose a chatacter and and enemy to play against.
 - Attack an enemy with attack points, doubling your attack points each time, and reducing the enemy's hitpoints.
   - at the same time your character's hit points decrease.
 - Traverse through the enemies until you lose, or win depending on last character standing.
